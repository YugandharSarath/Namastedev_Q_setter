### Topics covered by this React Chess project

* **React fundamentals:** components, props, state, event handling
* **Conditional rendering & UI state management**
* **Complex game logic implementation in JavaScript:**

  * Chess rules (move validation, castling, promotion, check/checkmate detection)
  * Board state updates immutably
* **Algorithmic thinking:** path validation for moves, attack detection
* **Modular code organization:** separating UI and logic (`chessLogic.js`, `utils.js`)
* **Testing concepts:** component-level testing with React Testing Library (if you add tests)
* **UX considerations:** highlighting possible moves, showing modals, restarting game

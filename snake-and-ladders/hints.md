### ðŸ’¡ Hints
- Use a 10Ã—10 grid (100 cells) arranged in reverse-alternating rows.
- Store snakes and ladders as a mapping object: `{ start: end }`.
- Use `setTimeout` or `setInterval` to animate player movement across the board.
- Ensure player doesn't move past square 100.
- Modularize your code: separate components for Dice, Board, Cell, and Player.

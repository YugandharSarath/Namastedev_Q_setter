### üîñ **Paginated Article Bookmark Viewer**

You are tasked with building a **React component** that displays a list of dummy articles (title + content), with the following functionalities:

---

### ‚úÖ **Core Features**

1.  **Display Articles**
    * Display a list of articles (e.g., 23 dummy articles).
    * Each article must have a **title**, **content**, and a **‚òÖ icon** to **toggle bookmark**.

2.  **Pagination**
    * Show only **5 articles per page**.
    * Use **Prev** and **Next** buttons to navigate between pages.
    * Prevent navigating below page 1 or above the last page.

3.  **Bookmark Toggle**
    * Each article can be **bookmarked/unbookmarked** by clicking the `‚òÖ` icon.
    * Toggling must update the state and show a **visual change** (e.g., a gold star if active).

4.  **Bookmark Filter**
    * Include a checkbox labeled **‚ÄúShow only bookmarked‚Äù**.
    * When checked, show only bookmarked articles (still paginated).
    * When unchecked, return to showing **all** articles.

5.  **State Persistence**
    * Bookmarks should remain toggled even after:
        * Navigating between pages.
        * Toggling the filter checkbox.

6.  **Empty State Handling**
    * If the ‚ÄúShow only bookmarked‚Äù filter is active and **no bookmarked articles exist**, show:
        > üëâ *‚ÄúNo articles to display.‚Äù*

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Edge Cases with `testId`'s**

1.  **Rapid Page Navigation:**
    * If a user clicks "Next" (`next-button`) and "Prev" (`prev-button`) rapidly, the component should handle it gracefully without crashing or jumping out of bounds.

2.  **No Bookmarked Articles with Filter On:**
    * If the user enables the **bookmark filter** (`bookmark-filter-checkbox`) when **no articles are bookmarked**, the message "No articles to display." (`no-articles-message`) should be shown clearly.

3.  **Toggling Bookmark While Filter is Active:**
    * If a user removes the bookmark from an article **while the filter is ON**, it should **immediately disappear** from the list (because it's no longer bookmarked). The bookmark icon is identified by `bookmark-icon-${article.id}` and the article card by `article-card-${article.id}`.

4.  **Navigation Away and Back:**
    * Bookmark states must **persist** regardless of page navigation‚Äîtoggling bookmarks should not be lost on navigating between pages. The bookmark icon is identified by `bookmark-icon-${article.id}`.

5.  **Filter Toggle Resets to Page 1:**
    * Whenever the ‚ÄúShow only bookmarked‚Äù checkbox (`bookmark-filter-checkbox`) is toggled, it must **automatically reset the current page to 1**.

6.  **Last Page Has Fewer Than 5 Articles:**
    * If the last page has fewer than 5 items (e.g., 3), show **only the remaining articles**, without errors. The articles are identified by `article-card-${article.id}`.

7.  **Rapid Toggle of ‚òÖ:**
    * If a user clicks the bookmark star (`bookmark-icon-${article.id}`) multiple times quickly, the **final state must reflect accurately** (i.e., bookmarked or not).

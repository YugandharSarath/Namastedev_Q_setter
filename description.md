## üß† Ultimate Color Perception Challenge

Build an advanced color guessing game where the user is shown a HEX color code and must pick the **exact match** from **5 subtly different** color boxes. These options should differ in only **1-3 RGB components**, making it difficult to distinguish.

### ‚úÖ Requirements

1. Show a heading: `Which color is #A1B2C3?`
   - Test ID: `target-color`

2. Show **5 color options**:
   - Exactly one correct color box (matching the HEX)
   - 4 distractors that are similar-looking (tweaked RGB values)
   - Test ID: `color-option-${i}`

3. On user click:
   - Lock further interaction
   - Show feedback:
     - ‚úÖ `"üéâ Correct!"` if right
     - ‚ùå `"‚ùå Incorrect! The correct color was #XXXXXX"` if wrong
   - Test ID: `result-message`

4. Show a "Play Again" button after feedback:
   - Generates new target color and new subtly-different options
   - Clears previous state
   - Test ID: `reset-button`
